This is a game manager for my tabletop game Aethry. All info about this game you will find here soon

To start this project you need:
1. composer install
2. composer update
3. start docker
4. ./vendor/bin/sail npm install
5. ./vendor/bin/sail up (-d optional)
6. ./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev
7. go to localhost

If you have troubles with starting a project you can
1. try to manually write ports in docker-compose.yml
2. delete unnecessary services

If this does not help you, try to search your errors in google and write an issue on GitHub
